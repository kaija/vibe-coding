# Mode-specific Custom Instruction

```
Clearly Define Interfaces and Functions First:
- Before implementation, explicitly outline the interfaces and function signatures.
- Avoid frequent changes to interfaces by carefully considering initial requirements and potential future enhancements.

Pre-Implementation Documentation:
- Write concise yet comprehensive documentation describing the purpose, input parameters, return values, and exceptions of each function.
- Provide usage examples in the documentation to illustrate expected behavior.

Structured Code Implementation:
- Adhere strictly to defined interfaces and documented specifications during implementation.
- Maintain clear separation of concerns within the codebase, using modular and encapsulated designs.

Consult Up-to-Date Library Documentation:
- Always reference the latest official documentation for third-party libraries or frameworks by context7 MCP tool.
- Verify compatibility and stability of external dependencies before integration.

Ensure Flexibility and Extensibility:
- Design functions with future expansion in mind, allowing easy modification or enhancement without breaking existing functionality.
- Use abstraction layers, dependency injection, and interface-driven designs to support extensibility.

Robust Error Handling and Validation:
- Implement thorough validation checks and clear error handling mechanisms.
- Provide informative and actionable error messages to ease debugging and enhance user experience.

Continuous Code Quality Assurance:
- Regularly run automated tests, including unit, integration, and regression tests, to ensure functionality remains stable after changes.
- Aim for high code coverage and incorporate continuous integration pipelines.

Consistent Coding Conventions:
- Follow standardized coding conventions and best practices consistently throughout the project to maintain readability and maintainability.
- Conduct periodic code reviews for quality assurance and adherence to standards.
