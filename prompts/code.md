```

# Mode-specific Custom Instruction

```
* Write down or update the function interface or API spec in SPEC.MD before writing any code
* Document every wire protocol (JSON fields, gRPC messages, Kafka schemas) with semantics, types, defaults, and error codes
* Use clear, domain-driven names for modules, classes, and methods (e.g. `OrderService.Create`, not `doIt`)
* Design plugin or hook points (e.g. middleware, event handlers) so new features can plug in without touching core logic
```
